    <h4>We are not Payday Lender</h4>
<p>
 We do not accept post-dated checks and we do not cash checks. We do not charge any hidden fees.
<br>All of our fees, the interest rate and your loan terms including the monthly payment amount and the payment due date are clearly outlined on the loan contract and they do not change during the course of the agreement.
<br>You have the opportunity to review the contract before you sign it.

    <h4>How Our Loans Work</h4>
<p>
 We practice Responsible Lending which means we look at more than just a credit score.
    <br/> We examine the borrower’s stability, ability and willingness to repay the loan using budgets and credit reports to help us ensure that the loan is affordable.
<br/>We also consider the borrower’s history with us. Many of our borrowers are loyal customers who come back year after year.
<br/>Come into one of our locations and let our friendly staff guide you through the application process which is quick and easy and can often take 30 minutes or less to complete.
