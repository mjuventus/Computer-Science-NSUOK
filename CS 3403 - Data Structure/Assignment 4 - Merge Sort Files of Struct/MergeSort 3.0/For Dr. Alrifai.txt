On the program, I provided 2 txt files for example. List1.txt and List2.txt

The program is designed to read the file in a format below:
Id_Number FirstName LastName GPA Major
example:
152056 John Doe 4.0 Science

How the program runs:
1. Type in the desired output file name with extensions (ex: "FullList.txt")
2. Type in the list files to merge and confirm it.
3. Program will create a file called merged.dat for the merged (but not sorted) list.
4. From the merged.dat file, program will read the data and turn it into an array of a structure.
5. Program detects the ID number of each students and sort it in ascending order.
6. After sorting the data, program will write a new file (from step 1) that contains a merged sorted data.
