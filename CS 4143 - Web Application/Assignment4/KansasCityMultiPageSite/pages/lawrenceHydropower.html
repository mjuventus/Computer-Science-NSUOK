    <h2>History of Hyrdopower in Lawrence Kansas </h2>
    <p> The earliest evidence of water wheels and watermills date back to the ancient Near East in the 4th century BC,[6] specifically in the Persian Empire before 350 BCE, in the regions of Iraq, Iran,[7] and Egypt.[8] In China, watermills were widely used since the Han dynasty (founded 206 BC). In China and the rest of the Far East, hydraulically operated "pot wheel" pumps raised water into crop or irrigation canals.[when?] In the Roman Empire (founded 27 BC), water-powered mills produced flour from grain, and were also used for sawing timber and stone. 
        The power of a wave of water released from a tank was used for extraction of metal ores in a method known as hushing. The method was first used at the Dolaucothi Gold Mines in Wales from 75 AD onwards, but had been developed in Spain at such mines as Las Médulas. Hushing was also widely used in Britain in the Medieval and later periods to extract lead and tin ores.[9] It later evolved into hydraulic mining when used during the California Gold Rush. 
        In the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age and Arab Agricultural Revolution (8th–13th centuries), engineers made wide use of hydropower as well as early uses of tidal power,[10] and large hydraulic factory complexes.[11] A variety of water-powered industrial mills were used in the Islamic world, including fulling mills, gristmills, paper mills, hullers, sawmills, ship mills, stamp mills, steel mills, sugar mills, and tide mills. By the 11th century, every province throughout the Islamic world had these industrial mills in operation, from Al-Andalus and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia.[12] Muslim engineers also used water turbines, employed gears in watermills and water-raising machines, and pioneered the use of dams as a source of water power, used to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines.[13] 
        Islamic mechanical engineer Al-Jazari (1136–1206) described designs for 50 devices, many of them water powered, in his book, The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices, including clocks, a device to serve wine, and five devices to lift water from rivers or pools, though three are animal-powered and one can be powered by animal or water. These include an endless belt with jugs attached, a cow-powered shadoof, and a reciprocating device with hinged valves.
